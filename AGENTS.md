# AGENTS.md

This file describes repository conventions for coding agents.

## Project Overview

A template for building typed Python libraries with a small public API, optional structlog-based logging setup for applications, and Pydantic Settings-based configuration.

Distribution name: `my-lib` | Python package: `my_lib` | Environment prefix: `MY_LIB_`

## Commands

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-groups --locked

# Tasks via poethepoet (uv run poe <name>)
uv run poe check        # fmt-check, lint, lint-imports, typecheck, test
uv run poe fmt          # ruff format .
uv run poe fmt-check    # ruff format --check .
uv run poe lint         # ruff check .
uv run poe lint-imports # import-linter layer contracts
uv run poe typecheck    # mypy (strict: src, tests, docs)
uv run poe test         # pytest (parallel, 95% branch coverage enforced)
uv run poe test-fast    # pytest without coverage, parallel, random order
uv run poe docs         # mkdocs serve
uv run poe audit        # pip-audit over locked dependencies

# Or run tools directly
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
uv run pytest --cov

# Install pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit on all files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Build the sdist and wheel
uv build

# Versioning
uv run cz bump           # bump version, update CHANGELOG, tag
uv run cz changelog      # update CHANGELOG only

# Build static docs site as CI does
uv run --group docs mkdocs build --strict
```

## Dependencies

- Put runtime imports in `[project].dependencies`, development tools in the `dev` group, and documentation tools in the `docs` group.
- Keep runtime dependencies minimal and lower bounds wide enough for library consumers; they share one environment with the application.
- Change dependencies through uv (`uv add`, `uv remove`) so `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` change together. Verify the lock with `uv sync --locked --all-groups`.
- Raise a direct dependency's lower bound when code needs a newer API. The locked environment does not check lower bounds; the CI `lowest` job does.
- Do not import packages that are installed only as transitive dependencies.
- Security floors for transitive dependencies go in `[tool.uv] constraint-dependencies`.
- Use the project environment for tools. Do not install packages manually into `.venv`.

## Change Workflow

- Inspect `git status` before editing. Preserve existing uncommitted changes and limit edits to the requested task.
- Run `uv run poe check` after code changes. After documentation, `mkdocs.yml`, or public docstring changes, also run `uv run --group docs mkdocs build --strict`.
- Do not lower coverage thresholds, disable checks, relax import-linter contracts, or add lint and type suppressions solely to pass CI. Explain necessary suppressions at the affected line.
- Use non-rewriting checks (`poe fmt-check`, `poe lint`) for verification; run formatters or `--fix` only when intentionally editing files. Pre-commit's Ruff hooks rewrite files.
- Report which checks ran, which were skipped, and why. `poe test-fast` is not the full CI suite: it skips coverage, and CI also runs tests on macOS, the lowest-dependency job, package and docs builds, and security scans.
- Treat everything exported from `my_lib/__init__.py` as public API. Mark removals and incompatible changes with `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer so Commitizen bumps the version correctly.
- When changing settings or public API, update `.env.example`, README, and MkDocs. Do not edit generated pages (configuration, API reference); edit `Settings` field descriptions and source docstrings instead.
- Keep the user's `.env` and secrets untracked.

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers on push/PR to `main` and `dev` and is reusable via
`workflow_call`. Workflow permissions are `contents: read`; actions are pinned to commit SHAs.
Parallel jobs:

- **`quality`** — `poe fmt-check`, `poe lint`, `poe lint-imports`, `poe typecheck`.
- **`test`** — `poe test` (95% branch coverage) on Ubuntu and macOS.
- **`lowest`** — installs the lowest allowed direct dependencies (`--resolution lowest-direct`)
  and runs pytest; it checks the declared lower bounds, which the lock does not.
- **`build`** — `uv build`, `mkdocs build --strict`, `poe audit`, trivy filesystem scan
  (CRITICAL/HIGH).

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on version tags (`v*`) and manual `workflow_dispatch`.
It runs CI first, then:

- **`build`** — `uv build`; uploads `dist/` as an artifact.
- **`publish`** — tags only; publishes `dist/` to **PyPI** with Trusted Publishing (OIDC, the
  `pypi` environment, `id-token: write`). No API token is stored. Skipped in the
  `rwrotson/python-lib-template` repository itself, so tagging the template only deploys docs.
- **`docs`** — builds the site with `mkdocs build --strict` and deploys it to **GitHub Pages** via
  `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages` (the `github-pages` environment).

In a project created from the template, PyPI needs a trusted publisher for the repository with workflow `release.yml` and environment
`pypi`. Pages Source must be set to **"GitHub Actions"** (Settings → Pages), and the
`github-pages` environment must allow the `v*` tag. Site:
https://rwrotson.github.io/python-lib-template/

Dependabot opens weekly grouped PRs for uv dependencies (`uv.lock`), GitHub Actions, and pre-commit
hooks (`.github/dependabot.yml`).

## Architecture

### Package Layout & Build

Source lives in `src/my_lib/` — the standard `src/` layout. The uv build backend is configured in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-name = "my_lib"
module-root = "src"
```

`src/my_lib/py.typed` marks the package as typed (PEP 561); keep it in the wheel.

Internal imports use the `my_lib.` prefix. Ruff bans relative imports except in package `__init__.py`, which may re-export from sibling modules (`from .module import ...`, never `..`):

```python
from my_lib.core.errors import InvalidInputError
from my_lib.config import LogSettings
```

### Layers & Public API

```
src/my_lib/__init__.py  — Public API re-exported with __all__; NullHandler on the "my_lib" logger
src/my_lib/core/        — Library functionality and the MyLibError hierarchy
src/my_lib/config/      — Settings (Pydantic Settings) for applications that configure the library
src/my_lib/utils/       — Optional helpers: setup_logging(), find_project_root()
```

Follow the layers in `docs/architecture.md`: `core` never imports `config`, `utils`, structlog, or Pydantic; `config` never imports `core` or `utils`; `utils` never imports `core`. import-linter contracts in `pyproject.toml` enforce the boundaries (`uv run poe lint-imports`).

Expected failures raise a `MyLibError` subclass. Subclass a built-in exception as well when callers would reasonably catch it (`InvalidInputError` is also a `ValueError`).

To add functionality: put it in `src/my_lib/core/`, export it from `core/__init__.py` and `my_lib/__init__.py` (`__all__`), test it in `tests/core/`, and list it in `docs/reference/index.md`.

### Import-Time Behaviour

Importing `my_lib` must not read the environment or `.env`, configure logging or structlog, add handlers outside the `my_lib` logger, or perform I/O. `tests/test_package.py` checks this in a fresh interpreter.

### Configuration via Environment Variables

`src/my_lib/config/settings.py` defines `Settings` (Pydantic `BaseSettings`, prefix `MY_LIB_`, nested delimiter `__`) with defaults in code and the section `LogSettings` (`MY_LIB_LOG__*`). Only `load_settings()` reads the environment and `.env`; empty values use defaults. Library code takes settings objects as arguments instead of loading them.

Every setting needs a `Field(description=...)` and a line in `.env.example`; tests in `tests/config/` enforce both. The docs configuration page is generated from `Settings` by `docs/gen_config_page.py`; do not edit it by hand.

### Logging

Library code logs through stdlib `logging.getLogger(__name__)` so records follow the application's configuration; the package logger has a `NullHandler`. Do not call `structlog.configure()` or `logging.basicConfig()` from library code.

`setup_logging()` in `my_lib.utils.log` is an opt-in helper for applications. It configures structlog bridged through stdlib via `ProcessorFormatter`: a stderr handler (`ConsoleRenderer`, or JSON with `MY_LIB_LOG__FORMAT=json`) and, when `MY_LIB_LOG__DIR` is set, a rotating JSON file handler. Calling it again replaces only its own handlers.

### Documentation Generation

`docs/gen_ref_pages.py` generates API pages from source modules. `docs/gen_config_page.py` builds the configuration page from `Settings` field types, defaults, and descriptions.

### Testing

`tests/` mirrors the package (`core/`, `config/`, `utils/`); `tests/test_package.py` covers the public API and import-time behaviour.

Tests run in parallel (pytest-xdist) and in random order (pytest-randomly); warnings are errors and each test has a 30-second timeout. Autouse fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` remove `MY_LIB_*` variables, run each test in a temporary working directory (so a local `.env` is not read), and restore logging and structlog configuration. pytest adds its own capture handlers to the root logger, so assert on the library's handlers only. Reproduce an order-dependent failure with `uv run pytest -p randomly --randomly-seed=<seed>`.

### Type Checking

MyPy runs with `strict = true` and the Pydantic plugin over `src/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`. All new code must have complete type annotations. Python 3.14 supports union syntax (`X | Y`), which is preferred over `Optional[X]`.

## Commit Handoff

- Do not create or amend commits on the user's behalf.
- After completing and verifying a meaningful, self-contained part of the work, pause before starting the next part.
- At each pause, send the user a one-line English Conventional Commit message for the completed work. Resume when the user asks you to continue.

## Documentation and Comments

- Write documentation, docstrings, and comments in English. Keep them short and factual. Describe each entity's purpose without editorial commentary or tutorials.
- Do not add module docstrings. Package docstrings in `__init__.py` are optional. Put package behavior and important module details in Markdown documentation such as `README.md` or `docs/`.
- Give public classes, functions, and ordinary methods a docstring. Prefer one line describing their overall purpose; do not repeat names, signatures, or type annotations. Ruff checks these in library code. Test functions, fixtures, and standard `dunder` methods are exempt.
- Add docstrings to protected or private objects only when they explain behavior that is not clear from code.
- Keep inline comments only for non-obvious behavior or decisions. Put a short comment on the relevant line when it fits; otherwise place it immediately above. Retain necessary tool directives such as `# noqa` and `# type: ignore`.
- Prefer clearer names and more precise types over comments that restate code.
